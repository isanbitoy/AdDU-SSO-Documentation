## Technology Application Context

The present study seeks to address a single sign-on based on java technology stack using JOSSO, a single
sign-on solution for web applications. It is an open source Java EE based software for user authentication and
authorization. It is also for rapid and standards based internet-scale Single Sign-On implementations, allowing
secure Internet access to the Web-based applications or services of customers, suppliers, and business
partners. The framework allows multiple web server/applications such as:

- #### <b>APACHE HTTP SERVER</b> - an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows NT.
- #### <b>APACHE TOMCAT</b> - a platform for developing and deploying web applications and web services which implements the Java Servlet and Java Server Pages technologies.
- #### <b>ASP</b> - a server-side Web application framework designed for Web development to produce dynamic Web pages.
- #### <b>PHP</b> - a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
- #### <b>JBOSS AS7</b> - an application server that implements the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. Version 7 being the current version and the most stable, with built-in JOSSO framework.

These web server/applications are used in order to authenticate users with credential store. JOSSO
communicates with credential stores over Lightweight Directory Access Protocol or JDBC connection.
Through its agent architecture, JOSSO enables these capabilities transparently, making integration so simple
it’s practically non-existent. In most cases, it won’t even require an application build.
