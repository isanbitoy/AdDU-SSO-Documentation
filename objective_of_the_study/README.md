## Objective of the Study

An authentication platform that will be implemented to Ateneo Systems as a unique log-in system which
saves the user from repeating his/her authentication credentials over and over again. JOSSO increases the
security feature of the application and extends the verification vectors of the project modules.

- #### To implement an authorization module that grants access control permission.
- #### To develop a faster login module that provides an SSO via JOSSO.
- #### To implement a reliable and secure authentication module that will retrieve the userâ€™s credentials.
