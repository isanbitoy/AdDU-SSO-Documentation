## Introduction

Are you a forgetful person? Do you forget things easily like where you put your car keys, or the password
for a particular website or social networking site? Did it ever occur to you to use the same username and
password for a couple, if not all, websites to be able to keep track of your account login details? There aren’t a
lot of people who know of the technology called Single Sign-On (SSO), which is already being used by big
companies and some are already using it yet they didn’t know that it was already SSO that they’re using.
These companies are usually social networking sites, websites that need an authentic email address, and some
other systems.

Most of these sites, services, and applications require some kind of signing-up applications or a
registration. You need to prove who you are, so the system knows what resources you have access to. Today,
you gain access to a site by the means of a username and password. For the user, this means if he/she has
multiple accounts she might have to type in her username and password at a dozen different sites or more.
Remembering different passwords on different social networking sites or even sites that you often visit and at
times you need to sign-on every time you need to access the site is really annoying, now try imagining a
program that can log you to different sites only providing a few sign-on details from a single sign-on
application, wouldn’t that make things faster?
