## Significance of the Study

This study is significantly related to a simple login/sign-on system, but with a unique feature to input
login credentials only once rather than accessing different websites many times and input the same login
credentials. This web application aims to implement authentication (identifying who someone is) and
authorization (deciding whether a specific user has rights to access a specific resource) modules which are
also common on other login/sign-on systems and which is also responsible for the login and security module
of the application. Through a java technology stack and by the implementation of JOSSO protocols that will
develop into a single login system where Ateneo students will be able to access several sites in the Ateneo
Systems without authenticating user accounts many times. With the use of this proposed application, students
may be able to minimize the time they need to login and they can immediately access the other Ateneo system
without the hassle of entering their login credentials again.
